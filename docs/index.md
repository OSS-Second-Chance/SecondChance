### Editing your Profile <a name="editting_profile"></a>    
Currently, we only support editting your profile picture by clicking the small pencil icon by your picture.  In the future the information will be relevant and you will be able to update your information here

### Matching <a name="matching"></a>
Our matching system consists of 4 seperate states.
1. Not Matched - Your default state with any user.  No connection between you two has been made    
2. Pending Match, Outgoing - You have requested a match with this user.  You can either rescend the request or wait for them to accept    
3. Pending Match, Incoming - You have recieved a match from this user.  You can either leave it pending and not accept, not creating a match, or you can accept and create a match with this user.    
4. Currently Matched - You are matched with this user.  In the future you will be able to message and exchange information
